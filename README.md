# Recognition using Deep Networks

## Project Overview

This project explores building, training, analyzing, and modifying deep neural networks for recognition tasks using the MNIST dataset. The objective is to demonstrate the effectiveness of neural networks in digit recognition, providing insights into their operations and capabilities. This project serves as a comprehensive guide through the creation and enhancement of a neural network, culminating in the application of these models in real-world scenarios.

## Demo Video

- [Live Digit Recognition Demo](https://northeastern.instructuremedia.com/embed/5f3db87e-5e8b-408b-9f1e-68317794b326) - Watch the neural network recognize digits in real-time through a webcam feed.

## Development Environment

- **Operating System:** Windows 10
- **IDE:** PyCharm 2023.2.1
- **Python Version:** 3.8
- **Primary Libraries:** PyTorch, Torchvision, OpenCV

## Features

- **Digit Recognition:** Train and test a neural network to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.
- **Network Analysis:** Analyze how different layers in the network process images.
- **Transfer Learning:** Adapt an existing network to recognize Greek letters.
- **Live Recognition:** Implement and demonstrate a live digit recognition application.
- **Pre-trained Network Evaluation:** Explore the functionalities of pre-trained models from PyTorch's model hub.

## Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine using:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/recognition-using-deep-networks.git
```
Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd recognition-using-deep-networks
```
Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Instructions for Running the Executables

To run any script, use the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
```bash
python <script_name>.py
```
Replace `<script_name>` with the name of the script you wish to execute. For example, to run the digit recognition training script, you would use:
```bash
python mnist_digit_recognition_training.py
```
